The Simpson Lab develops new ways to analyze biological sequence data.

Our computational work focuses on the development of algorithms for handling very large sequencing data sets, from indexing and text compression, to probabilistic modeling and inference. We make our methods freely available as open source software.

We apply our computational methods to de novo genome assembly, cancer genomics and (most recently) infectious disease. We collaborate closely with [Nick Loman's group at the University of Birmingham](http://lab.loman.net/) and [Winston Timp's lab at Johns Hopkins University](http://www.timplab.org/).
